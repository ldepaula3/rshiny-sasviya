# **R Shiny app with SAS Viya**
The repository supports the SAS Support Community Library article Creating an R Shiny app with SAS Viya (https://communities.sas.com/t5/SAS-Communities-Library/Creating-an-R-Shiny-app-with-SAS-Viya/ta-p/649029). Please refer to the article for the details of how to set up and run the application in your environment.

## Overview

There is not one solution or programing language that will deliver everything you need. That is why customizing the platform you already master is where you find value. In order to accomplish this, I've seen customers move directly to coding, in lieu of SAS user interfaces. This provides freedom and full control on how things get executed. This holds true for analytics and SAS Viya. 

This app, written in R Shiny, is a low-code solution that displays SAS integration through APIs with open source languages.

The interface developed in this repository will allow you to:<br/>
1. import data to CAS <br/>
2. build features <br/>
3. train models.<br/>

At the end, the user will have an end-to-end pipeline to test different approaches.

### Prerequisites

R shiny package https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/shiny/index.html <br/>
R-swat package https://github.com/sassoftware/R-swat/releases <br/>
